Open Source Surveillance System

For now it's just a draft. I decided to create this sytem because I don't know any open source system with described capabilities (there is some proprietary solutions, but you can't extend them in any way).

You can watch draft file in [yEd Graph Editor](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html)

I would be very happy to hear any thoughts about osss!
